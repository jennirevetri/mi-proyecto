00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.710
drop from my eye,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.150
you better save it for the middle of the

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.030
night and things on black and

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:29.910
white and to do it all remember.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.110
24,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.950
and

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.430
when I'm back in Chicago,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.150
I feel it, another virgin on me,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.190
I was in it,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.070
I wait goodbye to the end

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.910
of beginning.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.470
the song has started now and you're just

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.070
finding out now isn't there

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.630
a laugh major sacrifice but clueless

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.430

to caroline just trust me you'll be fine

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.270

I was in it,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.950
I will good back to the end of beginning,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.550

the man out of the city, not the city,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.950
you take the man out of the, and when I'm back in Chicago,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.750
I feel it, another version of me,
